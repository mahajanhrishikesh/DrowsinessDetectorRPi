Develop a system to detect the drowsiness of the driver and provide a solution to prevent possible accidents in the future.
The main idea behind this project is to develop a system which can detect drowsiness of any human and can issue a timely warning as a sound of buzzer.
Drivers who do not take regular breaks when driving long distances run a high risk of becoming in drowsy state which they often fail to recognize early enough.
According to various experts, studies show that motorway accidents are attributable to sleepy drivers in need of a rest, meaning that drowsiness causes more road accidents than drunk-driving. 
This system will monitor the driver eyes using a camera and by developing an algorithm we can detect symptoms of driver fatigue early enough to avoid the person from sleeping. 
So, this project will be helpful in detecting driverâ€™s fatigue in advance and will give warning output in form of alarm.
